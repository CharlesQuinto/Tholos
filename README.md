# Tholos

This is a baseline on how begin the process of committing changes to the maing branch

Added styles.css, eyesScript.Js and updated the index.html to look like the original prototype of our final PT.

When opening the website, you will be greeted by a closed eye.

Hovering over it opens the eye and clicking the eye makes the eye stay in its frozen state.

<-----v0.5----->

This is half an update where the original main page has been properly edited and styled to fit the atmosphere of the website.

In addition to this, we added a navigation hub which will contain the links that will lead to the other parts of the website. We custom icons placed on top of the eyes' pupil's which represent what the sites will lead to. The function of the javascript file is solely for the animation of the eye opening. 

<------v1.0----->

It is the launch of our website Tholos! 

All the main features of the website has been integrated with a pricing page, about page, contact us page and home page.

The website contains usage of CSS, HTML, Javascript and Bootstrap. The pricing page has the heaviest usage of 
boostrap.

This website uses a couple of custom made assets to fit in with the vibe of website from the two of us (Charles and Eric)

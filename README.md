This is a baseline on how begin the process of committing changes to the maing branch

Added styles.css, eyesScript.Js and updated the index.html to look like the original prototype of our final PT.

When opening the website, you will be greeted by a closed eye.

Hovering over it opens the eye and clicking the eye makes the eye stay in its frozen state.

<-----v0.5----->

This is half an update where the original main page has been properly edited and styled to fit the atmosphere of the website.

In addition to this, we added a navigation hub which will contain the links that will lead to the other parts of the website. We custom icons placed on top of the eyes' pupil's which represent what the sites will lead to. The function of the javascript file is solely for the animation of the eye opening.
